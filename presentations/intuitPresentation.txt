ARIA 1.0 - role = "drink"
aria-label = "bitter" , "tea", "coffee"
aria-describedby -> "A sweet zesty aroma with subtle fruits and gentle baked apples flavour leading to a warming finish that leaves you wanting more!
Colour: Warm Evening Sun"

Problem..... Should out label be the type of drink or are these distinct enough "things" that the role should be different?

Cue - aria-roledescription 
Allows us to add
aria-roledescription = "bitter" ,"tea", "coffee"
label - glass, cup, cup ??

aria-describedby.... problem?
What happens when we also need an error message

aria-errormessage - 

More realistic example

Pizza

SVG charts , role="application" aria-roledescription="Pie Chart", "Scatter Chart", "etc etc"
